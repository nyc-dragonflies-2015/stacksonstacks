#Overview
In this project, we will be working to reproduce [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). We're currently planning on using Ruby on Rails on the back-end and Javascript, HTML, and CSS on the front-end. Our tasks and progress can be monitored on our [trello board](https://trello.com/b/niwBScqg/the-tin-women). Feel free to check it out!
